"parser.py" contains the parser implementation.
We use a class named Token to store each token and the row it appears in.
we use a function to write a list of elememts into a file.
"chech_tokens_from_file" validates all tokens from a file and if the file is
lexically correct prints writes the content from PIF, the identifier symbol table and the
constant symbol table into 3 output files.
A file is considered lexically corect if all it's tokens either appear in the "token.in" file or
if they are a valid identifier or constant(integer, rational, string)
