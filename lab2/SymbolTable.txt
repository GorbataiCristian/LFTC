I used a binary search tree representation for the symbol tables
Each time you add a constant/identifier to the tree it is assigned an id,
if the entity already exists in the tree the id of the existing node is returned, 
otherwise a new node is created with the id assinged in the initialization and this id is returned.
I also implemented a delete functionality, not sure if we need it.
If node cannot be directly deleted we replace it with the lowest node from the right side of the BST.
